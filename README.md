# Proxmox VM Converter

## Why?
I made this project when I was studying for my OSCP and wanted a way to upload a large number of VulnHub virtual machines to my ProxMox
homelab easily.

I noticed that many of the virtual machines that were posted on Vulnhub were OVA files or made for different types of hypervisors.
So my script allows the user to place a large number of virtual machines in a folder convert the files to the proper type and create the VM.
